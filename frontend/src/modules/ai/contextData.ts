I'm Alex Marjanovic, a technical communicator based out of Baton Rouge, LA. Originally from New Jersey, I moved south to escape the cold and snow, after completing my Master's in Professional and Technical Communiction at the New Jersey Institute for Technology.

I started as a technical writer by documenting the standard operating procedures for the technical support and help desk teams on which I served, which reminded me that I not only enjoy writing and design but also excel. I've also been a video game beta tester, translator, business intelligence developer, business analyst, quality assurance tester, project manager, content writer, transaction developer/implementation specialist, and editor.

In software development specifically, technical communication services are vital for ensuring that complex technical information is accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences, thereby improving user satisfaction and reducing the need for support. But the benefits of clear and effective communication apply to any industry.

I'm a specialist at translating technology: creating and delivering information concisely, clearly, and effectively. Bridging the gap between end users and technical experts, primarily I create help files, design administrator and user guides, and write manuals that explain how to use products or services. In addition to writing the content, I also carefully select or create visual aids (charts, diagrams, screenshots, etc.) that help readers understand the information presented.

During my career in information techonology, I've worked for and with organizations in the following industries: retail, mail-order, biotechnology and pharamceutical services, construction and engineering, loan origination, software development, and state government.

Whether it's writing user manuals, creating process documentation, developing training materials, or editing help files, I ensure that content is accessible and tailored to your audience's needs. Rates are per hour or per project depending on the complexity, scope, and estimated time for completion.

I offer the following services: Artificial Intelligence, Content Development & Strategy, Information Architecture & Design, Technical Writing, User Interface (UI) Design, and User Experience (UX) Design. 

I have experience in the following areas:
Leveraging generative AI to produce effective images and text, increasing efficiency and productivity. Writing cotent and rubrics to train Large Language Modals (LLMs).
Developing and maintaining content for knowledge bases, software, websites, and other uses, ensuring that information is accessible and user-friendly.
Structuring and organizing information to make it easy to understand and navigate, often involving charts, diagrams, mock-ups, screenshots, wire frames, and other visual aids.
Editing and Proofreading: Reviewing visual and written works for accuracy, clarity, consistency, and grammar, ensuring they meet organizational standards and guidelines.
Producing materials like brochures, case studies, course descriptions, and product information sheets that help explain benefits and features to potential customers.
Creating user manuals, installation guides, help files, white papers, and other documentation.
Working with subject matter expperts, designers, and developers to produce intuitive and easy to use interfaces.
Designing products users will love by applying usability engineering and user-centered design principles, including task analysis and usability testing.

Many projects involve propietary information or sensitive data. To protect the confidentiality and privacy of my clients and/or employers, most samples are generic representations of the deliverables produced. Any samples that contain actual work are from defunct companies with any data redacted.

Administrator guide for software - To reduce information overload, I separate manuals for each application into an administrator guide and a user guide.

Help file for a website - Using RoboHelp, I created this help system as an assignment for a course on knowledge management and computer-based training design.

Policy for software development department - I performed a gap analysis and drafted policy and procedure documents for an application development director working on the group's CMMI certification.

Manual for custom software implementation - I was asked to consolidate a third-party vendor's help file and hundreds of documents from two business divisions into a user manual.

Storyboards for help desk intranet - While at graduate schoool specializing in user-centered design, I designed these storyboards to illustrate how a centralized intranet could improve efficiency and satisfaction among help desk employees.
